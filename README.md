# TownyFlight
Flight plugin for Towny servers.


Finally, you can allow towny residents to fly while in their own towns, for free, from the lead developer of Towny.

Requires the use of Towny 0.92.0.0 or newer.

Commands:

    /tfly - Enable/disable flight.
    /tfly reload - Reload the config.


Permission nodes:

    townyflight.command.tfly - required to use /tfly.
    townyflight.command.tfly.reload - required to reload the config.

Config:

    Config auto-updates with new features while keeping your old settings intact (like Towny.)
    Currently translates language strings.


I'm open to new features and willing to fix any bugs found.
