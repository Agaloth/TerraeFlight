# TownyFlight
Flight plugin for Towny servers.


Finally, you can allow towny residents to fly while in their own towns, for free, from the lead developer of Towny.

Requires the use of Towny 0.94.0.0 or newer.

## Commands:

- /tfly - Enable/disable flight.
- /tfly reload - Reload the config.
- /tfly {name} - (Console Only) Removes flight from someone.

## Permission nodes:

- townyflight.command.tfly - required to use /tfly.
- townyflight.command.tfly.reload - required to reload the config.
- townyflight.alliedtowns - allows players to use /tfly in towns which consider that player an ally.
- townyflight.alltowns - allows players to use /tfly in any town, but not the wilderness.
- townyflight.bypass - default to Ops, bypasses removal of flight, use /tfly anywhere.





I'm open to new features and willing to fix any bugs found.
